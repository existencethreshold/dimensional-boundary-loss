# Robustness Validation Tests

This directory contains supplementary robustness tests referenced in Section 4.3 of the paper.

## Test Scripts

- **`test_grid_size_sensitivity.py`** - Validates the 86% finding across multiple grid sizes (N ∈ {15, 17, 20, 23, 25})
- **`test_highlife_validation.py`** - Tests rule independence by comparing Conway's Life (B3/S23) with HighLife (B36/S23)
- **`test_metric_sanity_check.py`** - Validates Φ metric behavior on edge cases (all dead, all alive, checkerboard, single cell)

## Running Tests

Each test script is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
python test_grid_size_sensitivity.py
python test_highlife_validation.py
python test_metric_sanity_check.py
```

Tests will generate timestamped JSON output files in the current directory containing detailed results.

## Pre-Run Validation Data

The `validation_data/` directory contains reference results from the latest test runs:

- `grid_size_validation_20260113_035847.json` - Grid size robustness results
- `highlife_validation_20260113_035936.json` - Rule independence comparison
- `metric_sanity_check_20260113_040017.json` - Edge case validation

These results are provided for convenience and can be regenerated by running the test scripts.

## Primary Validation Data

**Note:** The main validation results cited in the paper (1,500 patterns across 5 grid sizes for three dimensional transitions) are located in:

```
../validation_results_multisize/
```

The tests in this directory are **supplementary robustness checks** that validate specific claims made in the paper's robustness testing section.

## Test Details

### Grid Size Sensitivity Test
- **Purpose:** Confirm scale-independence of 86% loss
- **Method:** Runs validation on 5 different grid sizes
- **Expected Result:** Mean loss ~86% with low variation across sizes

### HighLife Validation Test  
- **Purpose:** Confirm rule-independence of geometric effect
- **Method:** Compares information loss using HighLife rule (B36/S23) vs Conway's Life (B3/S23)
- **Expected Result:** Difference < 1% between rules

### Metric Sanity Check
- **Purpose:** Validate Φ metric behaves correctly on edge cases
- **Method:** Tests known patterns (all dead, all alive, checkerboard, single cell)
- **Expected Result:** Φ = 0 for uniform patterns, Φ > 0 for heterogeneous patterns

## Reproducibility

All test scripts use fixed random seeds for reproducibility. Running the same test script multiple times will produce identical results.
